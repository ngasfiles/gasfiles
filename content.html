(1) This informative (non-mandatory)Annex is written in normative (mandatory) language to facilitate adoption where the users of the Code or regulatory authories which to adapt it formally as additional requirements to this Code.<br>
(2) This Annex is an extract from Clause 12.4.15 of CSA Z662.</small></blockquote>

<h2>12.4.15 Customer’s meters and service regulators
<small></h2>Note: Meter location and installation requirements of Clause 12.4.15 apply to meters that are designed and tested as
specified in AGA B109.1 or equivalent.</small><br><br>
<b>12.4.15.1<br><br></b>
Customers’ meters and service regulators may be located either inside or outside buildings, depending
on local conditions. If the service regulator is located inside the building<blockquote>
(a) The service line shall be designed to mitigate an uncontrolled release of gas inside the building
should a failure occur.<br>
(b) The presence of the gas service should be clearly indicated with permanent marking outside of the
building.</blockquote>

<b>Notes:</b><blockquote>
(1) Permanent marking may be accomplished by labelling or yellow paint and, if practical, words indicating the contents
of the piping, as follows:<blockquote>
(a) clear indication on the wall of the building using labelling or paint;<br>
(b) clear indication on the service piping by labelling or painting the pipe; or<br>
(c) pavement markers.<br></blockquote>
(2) Examples of satisfactory mitigation methods include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:<blockquote>
(a) installing an excess flow valve at or close to the service line connection to the main; or<br>
(b) installing an outside above grade shutoff valve prior to the piping entrance.<br></blockquote>

<b>12.4.15.2</b><br>
For service lines requiring series regulation as specified in Clause 12.4.11.1(b), the upstream regulator
shall be located outside the building.<br><br>
<b>12.4.15.3</b><br>
Where installed within buildings, customers’ meters and regulators shall be in readily accessible locations
that afford reasonable protection from thermal stresses and sources of heat, mechanical stresses, and
chemical deterioration. Service regulators shall be located near the piping entrance and, where practical,
the meters shall be installed at the same locations. For service lines supplying large industrial customers
and installations where gas is used at higher than standard service pressure, the regulators may be
installed at other readily accessible locations.<br><br>
<b>12.4.15.4</b><br>
Where located outside buildings, meters and regulators shall be installed in readily accessible locations.
Where outside meters and regulators are installed in locations that do not afford reasonable protection
from damage, such protection shall be provided.<br><br>
<b>12.4.15.5</b><br>
Regulators requiring vents for proper and effective operation, unless manufactured or equipped to limit
the escape of gas from their vent opening, even in the event of an operating diaphragm failure, to less
than 0.0283 m3/h, shall be vented to the outside atmosphere and shall terminate in rain- and
insect-resistant fittings.<br><br>
<b>12.4.15.6</b><br>
Where regulator failure would result in the release of gas, open ends of the vents shall be located where
the gas can escape freely into the atmosphere and away from any openings in the buildings. Clearances
from building openings shall be commensurate with local conditions and the volume of gas that can be
released, but shall not be less than those specified in [CSA] B149.1. Where regulators can be
submerged during floods, either a special anti-flood-type breather vent fitting shall be installed or the
vent line shall be extended above the height of the expected flood waters.<br><br>
<b>12.4.15.7</b><br>
Vaults and pits housing meters and regulators shall be designed and constructed to support the loads
that can be imposed upon the meters and regulators.<br><br>
<b>12.4.15.8</b><br>
Meter support shall be provided if the downstream connecting piping is other than rigid piping.
Note: Inadequate support of the meter can result if the outlet of the meter is connected to flexible metallic tubing.<br><br>
<b>12.4.15.9</b><br>
Regulator and relief vent piping shall be <blockquote>
(a) capable of withstanding the maximum pressures as specified in Clause 12.4.9 and 12.4.10;<br>
(b) included in the determination of the relief system capacity specified in Clause 4.18.3.2;<br>
(c) composed of metallic material where installed within buildings; and<br>
(d) designed, fabricated, and installed to prevent static build-up and mechanical damage where
plastic materials are used.</blockquote></blockquote>

<h1>Annex C (informative)</h1>
<big>Vent sizing tables for Category I natural gas and propane appliances</big><br>
Reference Tables in codebook  (C.1 - C.10)<br><br>

<small>Note: This informative Annex has been written in normative language to facilitate adoption where users of the Code or
regulatory authorities wish to adopt it formally as additional requirements to this Code.</small><br><br>
<br>



<big>C.1 General</big><br><br>
<b>C.1.1<br></b>
These tables were developed to provide a convenient method of determining vent sizes for venting
natural-draft and fan-assisted Category I appliances. Additionally, the tables provide the vent sizes that
apply to spillage-susceptible appliances such as natural-draft appliances in either tight structures (as
defined in Clause 8.2.1) or structures where the mechanical ventilation is designed for no more than 5 Pa
(0.02 in w.c.) depressurization.
<br><br>

C.1.2<br></b>
The values applicable to spillage-susceptible appliances are listed in the DP (depressurization) column and
are based upon building depressurization of 0.02 in w.c. (5 Pa). The DP column shall not be used for
mechanically ventilated systems that allow more than 0.02 in w.c. (5 Pa) depressurization, nor can
spillage-susceptible appliances be installed in this type of environment.<br><br>

C.1.3<br></b>
Currently, this Code does not provide vent sizing for Category I fan-assisted appliances and for
spillage-susceptible appliances under depressurization. These tables address this deficiency in the Code.
Values under the DP column apply only to installations containing draft-hood-equipped appliances or
combinations of Category I fan-assisted appliances and draft-hood-equipped appliances. These tables also
provide vent sizes for several vented appliances that share a common vent, and vent sizes for tile-lined
masonry chimneys.<br><br>
<small>Notes:<br>
(1) The Installation Code Committee gratefully acknowledges the research conducted by the Canadian Gas Research
Institute (CGRI) and the independent research sponsored by the Gas Research Institute to generate the tables in this
Annex. The research was conducted using a computer program, VENT-II, developed by Batelle. Recognition is given to
both research organizations for allowing CSA to publish the tables in this Annex.<br>
(2) For vent-sizing requirements not covered by the tables in this Annex, please refer to the applicable installation codes.<br>
(3) Please refer to Clause 3 of this Code for definitions of terms used in this Annex.<br><br>
</small>
<br><br>

<big>C.2 General Venting Requirements (GVR)</big><br><br>

<b>C.2.1<br></b>
All requirements contained in this Annex apply to both Category I draft-hood-equipped and Category I
fan-assisted combustion appliances. At no time shall a venting system for a certified Category II, III, or IV
appliance be sized with these tables. The alternative sizing methods described in this Code may also be
used to size the venting system for a draft-hood-equipped appliance. At this time, alternative sizing
methods have not been developed for fan-assisted appliances; therefore, until engineering data is
developed to allow alternative sizing methods for Category I fan-assisted appliances, these vent tables shall
be used.<br><br>

<b>C.2.2<br></b>
The vent tables included in this Annex apply to vents and chimneys internal to the structure below the roof
line. Exterior chimneys or vents not enclosed by the structure or a chase below the roof line can experience
continuous condensation, depending on locality. A chimney with one or more sides exposed to the outside
of the structure shall be considered to be an exterior chimney. A Type B vent or a certified chimney lining
system passing through an unused masonry chimney flue shall not be considered to be exposed to the
outdoors. The DP column shall be used to determine the capacity of a venting system within a building
constructed in accordance with Clause 8.2.1.<br><br>

<b>C.2.3<br></b>
If the vent or vent connector size, determined from the tables, is smaller than the appliance draft-hood
outlet or flue collar, the smaller size may be used, provided that<br>
(a) the total vent height (H) is at least 10 ft (3 m);<br>
(b) vents or vent connectors for appliance draft-hood outlets or flue collars 12 in (305 mm) in diameter or
smaller are not reduced more than one table size [e.g., 12 in (305 mm) to 10 in (254 mm) is a
one-size reduction];<br>
(c) vents or vent connectors for appliance draft-hood outlets or flue collars above 12 in (305 mm) in
diameter are not reduced more than two table sizes [e.g., 24 in (610 mm) to 20 in (508 mm) is a
two-size reduction];<br>
(d) the maximum capacity listed in the tables for a fan-assisted appliance is reduced by 10% (calculated
as 0.90 × maximum capacity); and<br>
(e) the draft-hood outlet is greater than 4 in (102 mm) in diameter. For example, a 3 in (76 mm)
diameter vent or vent connector shall not be connected to a 4 in (102 mm) diameter draft-hood
outlet. This provision shall not apply to fan-assisted appliances.<br><br>

<b>C.2.4<br></b>
A single-appliance venting configuration with zero lateral lengths is assumed to have no elbows in the vent
system in Tables C.1 and C.2. For all other vent configurations of single or multiple appliances, each vent
connector shall be assumed to have two 90° turns. For each additional 90° turn or its equivalent*, the
maximum capacity of each individual vent connector listed in the venting table should be reduced by 10%
(calculated as 0.90 × maximum listed capacity) for a natural draft appliance and 15% for a fan-assisted
appliance. Except for manifolded common vents (see Figure C.9), the final turn into the vertical vent shall
be counted as one 90° turn for each vent connector.
*Two 45° turns are equivalent to one 90° turn.<br><br>

<b>C.2.5<br></b>
If vent connectors are combined prior to entering the common vent, the maximum common vent capacity
listed in the common venting tables shall be reduced by 10%, the equivalent of one 90° elbow
(0.90 × maximum common vent capacity). See Figure C.9. The horizontal length of the common vent
connector manifold (L in Figure C.9) should not exceed 1-1/2 ft (457 mm) for each inch (25.4 mm) of
common vent connector manifold diameter.<br><br>

<b>C.2.6<br></b>
If the common vertical vent is offset as shown in Figure C.10, the maximum common vent capacity
listed in the common venting tables should be reduced by 20%, the equivalent of two 90° elbows
(0.80 × maximum common vent capacity). The horizontal length of the offset shall not exceed 1-1/2 ft
(457 mm) for each inch (25.4 mm) of common vent diameter.<br><br>

<b>C.2.7<br></b>
Use sea-level input rating when determining maximum capacity for high-altitude installation. Use actual
input rating for determining minimum capacity for high-altitude installation.<br><br>


<b>C.2.8<br></b>
For appliances with modulating input rates, the minimum vent or vent connector (FAN Min) capacity
(determined from the tables) shall be less than the lowest appliance input rating, and the maximum vent
or vent connector (FAN or NAT Max) capacity (determined from the tables) shall be greater than the
highest appliance input rating.<br><br>

<b>C.2.9<br></b>
A fan-assisted furnace may be common-vented into an existing masonry chimney, provided that<br>
(a) the chimney is currently serving at least one draft-hood-equipped appliance; and<br>
(b) the vent connectors and chimney are sized in accordance with Tables C.7 and C.8.<br><br>

<b>C.2.10<br></b>
Single-appliance venting of a fan-assisted furnace into a tile-lined masonry chimney shall be prohibited.
The chimney shall first be lined with either a Type B vent, sized in accordance with Table C.1 or C.2, or a
certified lining system.<br><br>

<b>C.2.11<br></b>
Certified, corrugated metallic chimney liner systems in masonry chimneys shall be sized according to
Table C.1 or C.2 for dedicated venting and Table C.3 or C.4 for common venting, with the maximum
capacity reduced by 20% (0.80 × maximum capacity) and the minimum capacity as shown in the
applicable table. Corrugated metal vent systems installed with bends or offsets require additional
reduction of the vent maximum capacity (see Clause C.2.6).<br><br>

<b>C.2.12<br></b>
For multiple units of gas-utilization equipment all located on one floor, available total height shall be
measured from the highest draft-hood outlet or flue collar up to the level of the cap or terminal. Vent
connector rise shall be measured from the draft-hood outlet or flue collar to the level where the vent gas
streams come together. (This is not applicable to multi-storey installations.)<br><br>

<b>C.2.13<br></b>
For multi-storey installations, available total height for each segment of the system shall be the vertical
distance between the highest draft-hood outlet or flue collar entering that segment and the centreline of
the next higher interconnection tee. (See Figure C.11.)<br><br>

<b>C.2.14<br></b>

<h1>Annex G (informative)</h1>

<big><u>Piping expansion and flexibility</u></big><br>

<small>Note: This informative (non-mandatory) Annex has been written in normative (mandatory) language to facilitate adoption where users of the Code or
regulatory authorities wish to adopt it formally as additional requirements to this Code.</small><br><br>

<b>G.1 General</b><br>
Problems are not usually experienced in residential piping systems with thermal expansion because
the piping or tubing is relatively short. <br>
However, in commercial and industrial buildings, there can be substantial variations in the lengths of piping or tubing mains as the indoor temperature changes on weekends or between seasons. It is therefore essential
that provisions be made in the piping design for flexibility to avoid undesirable bending and strong forces
at elbows or joints. <br><br>

This flexibility is obtained by the use of designed pipe bends, loops, offsets, expansion, hints, or swivel
joints. The piping or tubing shall be anchored at appropriate locations to control the direction of expansion and
contraction.<br><br>



<b>G.2 Gas piping to rooftop units</b><br>
Due to the wide range of temperatures on a roof between summer and winter, piping design shall provide
for expansion and contraction. Because of the exposure to sunlight and rain or snow, coated or wrapped
gas piping is not recommended. Bare steel piping and fittings shall be cleaned after assembly, painted
with a metal primer, and given at least one coat of exterior enamel paint.
Expansion control loops should be used on pipe sizes of 2 in (50 mm) or less whenever the unrestrained
pipe length is at least 100 ft (30 m). Larger diameter piping is generally installed with expansion joints.<br>
As shown in Figure G.1, the control loop consists of 90° offsets to the main pipe run so it provides an
open-ended box configuration.
For purposes of design, a 90° change of direction or an offset may be considered the equivalent to a
control loop when the offset length is at least three times Dimension A in Figure G.1.
Some form of thermal expansion control shall be provided for each 100 ft (30 m). For example, a
200 ft (61 m) length shall be anchored in the centre between each loop. The anchor of an offset or
90° bend should be not closer than 10 ft (3 m) from the bend to permit expansion.
Suitable pipe supports are commercially available to permit the free movement of piping when it
expands and contracts.  <br><br>

<h1>ANNEX K</h1>
<big>Pressure regulators and overpressure protection devices</big><br><br>
<small>Note: This Annex is not a mandatory part of this Code.</small><br><br>

<big>K.1 Pressure control and regulation</big><br><br>
Figure K.1 illustrates the requirements of Clause 5 for pressure control, regulation, and overpressure protection.<br><br>
<p align="center"><img border="2" src="b149\AnnexKImg.jpg"></p>
<br><Br>
<h1>K.2 ANSI Z21.80/CSA 6.22 Line pressure regulators</h1><br>

<big>K.2.1</big><br>
ANSI Z21.80/CSA 6.22 applies to line pressure regulators for use with either natural gas or propane.
These regulators are used where it is necessary to reduce the delivered pressure after the utility service
regulator to the required inlet pressure to the appliance.<br><br>
ANSI Z21.80/CSA 6.22 only applies to regulators with an inlet pressure of either 2, 5 or 10 psig (13.8,
34.5, or 68.9 kPa), and for outlet pressures of either 2 psig (13.8 kPa), or 0.5 (3.5 kPa) psig or less, and
are organized into Class I or Class II regulators as shown in Table K.1.
<br><br><br>

<p align="center"><img border="1" src="b149\AnnexKImg2.jpg"></p>
<br><br><br>

<big>K.2.2</big><br><br>
<b>K.2.2.1</b><br>
ANSI Z21.80/CSA 6.22 includes requirements for overpressure protection devices of the following types:<br>
a) overpressure shut-off device;<br>
b) overpressure relief device (either a regulator with internal relief, or by use of an external relief
device); and<br>
c) monitoring regulator.<br><br>

<b>K.2.2.2</b><br>
ANSI Z21.80/CSA 6.22 only requires a line pressure regulator to be provided with an overpressure
protection device under the following conditions:<br>
a) The rated inlet pressure to the regulator is greater than 2 psig (13.8 kPa) [i.e., rated to either 5 psig
or 10 psig (34.5 or 68.9 kPa);<br>
b) The outlet pressure is capable of being adjusted to deliver a pressure of 0.5 psig (3.5 kPa) or less;<br>
and
c) The overpressure protection device is set to limit the downstream pressure to a maximum of 2 psig
(13.8 kPa) in the event of a failure of the regulator.<br><br>
If a separate overpressure protection device is used, ANSI Z21.80/CSA 6.22 requires that the
overprotection pressure device be factory pre-assembled and supplied to the field as a unit. This would
apply to overpressure shut-off devices, monitoring regulators (where a separate regulator is used), and
a line relief valve.
<br><br>
The testing of the overpressure protection device only determines that, once the protection device has
activated, the downstream pressure does not exceed 2 psig (13.8 kPa). This means that for an appliance
with an inlet pressure of 14 in w.c. or less, in event of a failure of the upstream line pressure regulator,
the appliance could be subjected to pressures of up to 2 psig (14 kPa).
<br><br>

<b>K.2.3</b><br>
When the operating pressure is required to be greater than 2 psig (13.8 kPa), then a high pressure
regulator (uncertified) will need to be used, since there is presently no certified regulator available that
can regulate the outlet pressure to more than 2 psig.
<br><br>

<big>K.3 Types of overpressure protection devices</big><br><br>

<b>K.3.1 Monitoring regulators</b><br>
Monitoring regulators consist of a working regulator and a second regulator which “monitors” the
downstream pressure of the working regulator. In the event of a failure of the working regulator, the
monitoring regulator will then operate to control the downstream pressure and should be set to deliver
a safe operating pressure (i.e., in accordance with overpressure setpoint requirements). If a working
regulator fails, it is usually because of a failure of the diaphragm, in which case gas will leak into the
upper diaphragm chamber and be vented through the bleed vent; the odour should then attract
attention to the failed regulator.<br><br>
The monitoring regulator may be constructed either as<br>
a) a physically separate regulator, mounted either downstream of the working regulator, or mounted
upstream of the working regulator and provided with a regulation sensing line piped downstream
of the working regulator; or<br>
b) an integrated regulator mounted directly to the working regulator.
In either case, the operating principle is the same.
In event of a failure of the working regulator, this arrangement will continue to supply pressure to the
downstream system, at the pressure to which the monitoring regulator is set.<br><br>

<b>K.3.2 Overpressure shut-off device (or cut-off device)</b><br>
An overpressure shut-off device is a special diaphragm valve mounted upstream of the working
regulator and provided with an external registration line piped to the downstream side of the working
regulator.
In the event of a failure of the working regulator, when the downstream pressure rises above setpoint,
the shut-off device will close the supply of gas to the system. The pressure setpoint, therefore, must be
in accordance with overpressure setpoint requirements.<br><br>

<b>K.3.3 Regulator with internal relief</b><br>
A line pressure regulator with internal relief has a pressure relief valve that is built into the diaphragm
of the working regulator that senses downstream pressure. On a pressure rise above its setpoint, the
internal relief valve opens, causing downstream gas to pass into the upper diaphragm chamber, to be
vented to the outdoors through the regulator vent port. The pressure setpoint, therefore, must be in
accordance with overpressure setpoint requirements.
<br><br>
The regulator will continue to supply gas to the downstream system.<br><br>

<small>Note: Some regulators are offered with partial internal relief, meaning they have limited relieving capacity and
might not control the downstream pressure. This Code requires internal relief valves to fully relieve the capacity of
the regulator.</small><br><br>

<b>K.3.4 Line relief valve</b><br>
Similar in function to the regulator with internal relief, the line relief valve is mounted on piping
network immediately downstream of the pressure regulator.<br>
<small>Note: Where a line pressure regulator is certified to ANSI Z21.80/CSA 6.22 and a line relief valve is used, the relief
valve must be provided with the regulator as a complete set.</small><br><br>

<b>K.3.5 Overpressure protection setpoints</b><br>
Clause 5.3 specifies the requirements for use of overpressure protection devices and for setting of their
control setpoints. Figure K.2 illustrates the logic for determining these requirements.
<br><br>

<p align="center"><img border="2" src="b149\AnnexK2.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><img border="2" src="b149\AnnexK2b.jpg"></p>
<br><br><br><br>


<big>K.4 Multi-stage regulation for natural gas</big><br><br>
Where the delivery pressure after the service regulator is other than 2, 5, or 10 psig (13.8, 34.5, or
68.9 kPa) and the appliance inlet pressure is 2 psig (13.8 kPa) or less, then two (or more) stages of line
pressure regulators will be required. The first-stage regulator will reduce the service delivery pressure to
a pressure of 2, 5, or 10 psig (13.8, 34.5, or 68.39 kPa), and then the second–pressure regulator (i.e.,
uncertified regulator since there is presently no certified regulator available that can regulate the outlet
pressure to greater than 2 psig (13.8 kPa). See Figure K.3.
<br><br><br>
<p align="center"><img border="2" src="b149\AnnexK3.jpg"></p>
<br><br><br>

<big>K.5 Leak limiters and ventilated spaces</big><br><br>
Line pressure regulators certified to ANSI Z21.80/CSA 6.22 can be provided with a vent limiter (also
known informally as a leak-limiting device), which, if there is a small leak in the diaphragm, will limit the
leakage rate through the regulator vent connection to a prescribed amount. The Code permits such
regulators to be installed inside the building and does not require the regulator to be piped to outdoors provided the regulator is located in a ventilated space. While high pressure regulators and
other uncertified regulators may also be equipped with a vent limiter, this Code does not allow this
exemption for such pressure regulators.<br><br>
While the Code provides a definition for a ventilated space, it does not state any performance criteria to
demonstrate if the space is suitably ventilated to prevent a hazardous accumulation of gas in the space.
However, if such demonstration is required by an authority having jurisdiction, CSA C22.1, rule 18-006,
Appendix B, references API RP 505, which states that the concentration of a flammable gas should not
exceed 25% of the lower explosion limit (LEL) of a flammable gas for a room to be a “ventilated room”.
This 25% LEL is commonly used in other standards as an upper control limit.<br><br>
Natural gas LEL is 5% by room volume. For a pressure regulator emitting 2.5 CFH natural gas, and for
itnot to exceed 1.25% by room volume, then the space must have an air change rate of only 200 CFH or
3.33 CFM. This is a very low ventilation rate (it cannot be measured accurately by commercial
measuring equipment).<br><br>
For propane, the LEL is 2.1% by room volume. At a release rate of 1 CFH, this has the same ventilation
rate for natural gas (i.e., a ventilation rate of 200 CFH or 3.333 CFM).<br><br>
One possible means of meeting this requirement is to provide a mechanical ventilation system that will
exhaust 500 ft3in 1 h (on a continuous or non-continuous basis); this will provide a factor of safety of
2.5:1 to allow for incomplete mixing of the gas in the space. For a continuous ventilation system,
500 CFH is only 8.3 CFM. If the fan only operates 5 min per h, then the required ventilation exhaust rate
is 100 CFM. For comparison, a typical residential washroom exhaust fan is 80 to 100 CFM.

<big>Mandatory Safety Checks for Residential (one or two family dwelling) Natural Draft Boilers Equipped with a Draft Control Device 300,000 Btuh or less.</big><br><br>
SCHEDULE A – OWNER/USER INFORMATION SHEET<br><br>
<b>Mandatory Inspection of Gas (Natural Gas and Propane) Fired Natural Draft Boilers Equipped with a Draft Control Device</b><br><br>

<u>Attention Property Owner/User:</u><br><br>

The Technical Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA) has the mandate to maintain and improve safety for Ontario residents in the fuels and other regulated sectors. TSSA is officially designated by Ontario’s Ministry of Government and Consumer Services to administer and enforce the Technical Standards and Safety Act, 2000, which governs fuels safety in Ontario.<br><br>
TSSA has determined that the use of natural gas and propane burning natural draft boilers equipped with a draft control device may result in a carbon monoxide (CO) safety hazard in the home, that may cause personal injury up to and including death.<br><br>
CO is a colourless gas produced when fuels such as natural gas and propane burn incompletely. CO itself is odourless and tasteless but it may be accompanied by an abnormal odour of incomplete fuel combustion. Symptoms of CO poisoning include nausea and vomiting, dizziness, burning eyes, difficulty breathing, confusion and loss of consciousness.<br><br>
Investigated CO incidents have shown that key contributing causes of the incidents are that:<br><br>
<blockquote>• many boilers are not being maintained in accordance with the boiler manufacturer’s instructions. It is imperative that boilers are cleaned properly on a regular basis to reduce the likelihood of CO production.</blockquote>
<blockquote>• chimneys intended to evacuate CO and smoke from the boilers to the outdoors, are not properly operating due to other exhaust systems (such as wood fireplaces, dryer exhausts, new kitchen exhausts, etc.) and the installation of new, more energy efficient windows and doors. These systems and home upgrades limit the outside air infiltration into the home and cause the house to depressurize.</blockquote>
To address this situation, TSSA is legally requiring that all heating contractors perform a CO safety check when a technician enters a home with a boiler. The technician is obligated to take action when an unsafe condition is identified. These checks will be required when a technician enters a home with this type of boiler regardless of whether the homeowner/user has requested service on that boiler. This check is only required once during the heating season. The gas technician is also required to visually examine the boiler and if there are signs of poor operation, additional steps may be required including a home depressurization test or non-compliances corrected by adding combustion air, make-up air, installing a water bypass, etc.<br><br>
TSSA is requiring that CO alarm(s) be located in the vicinity or within the sleeping quarters of the home. The technician is required to ensure that the alarm(s) is/are present. If alarms are missing, the technician is required to issue written notification that the alarms must to be installed. If the alarms are not installed within the notification time limit, the fuel supply to your home will be shut off.<br><br>
As an equipment owner/user, TSSA and industry remind you of your responsibility to properly maintain and operate your boiler and all other fuels burning equipment. Annual maintenance, as a minimum, by a qualified contractor is the best method to fulfil this requirement.<br><br>
If there are safety issues identified during this mandatory inspection, the boiler will need to be serviced and depending on what type of service is necessary, the cost will vary. To best ensure the continued safety of you and your family, we ask that you allow the technician’s inspection/evaluation, and that you have your boiler maintained on a regular basis.<br><br>
If you do not allow the inspection or non-compliances are identified such as no CO alarm(s) present, your boiler will be identified as requiring compliance within a specified time. If that time lapses and the inspection is not completed or non-compliances are not corrected, the fuel supply to your boiler or home will be shut-off. If there is an immediate hazard identified during the inspection that cannot be corrected, the fuel supply to the boiler will be immediately terminated.<br><br>
TSSA and the associated industries thank you in advance for your co-operation in this regard. If you require further clarification or have questions, please ask the gas technician performing the inspection, your fuel supplier or TSSA toll-free at 1-877-682-8772.

SCHEDULE C – DEPRESSURIZATION TEST<br><br>


The following steps shall be followed for the depressurization test:<br>
1. With the boiler and other appliances connected to the same common vent not in operation:<br>
<blockquote>a. Seal any unused openings in the common venting system;</blockquote>
<blockquote>b. Visually inspect the venting system for proper size and horizontal pitch and determine there is no blockage or restriction, leakage, corrosion and other deficiencies which could cause an unsafe condition;</blockquote>
<blockquote>c. Insofar as is practical, close all building doors and windows and all doors between the space in which the appliances remaining connected to the common venting system are located and other spaces of the building. Turn on clothes dryers and any appliance, including gas fireplaces, not connected to the common venting system. Turn on any exhaust fans, such as range hoods and bathroom exhausts, so they will operate at maximum speed. Do not operate a summer exhaust fan. Close fireplace dampers for solid fuel fireplaces.</blockquote>
2. Allow the exhaust equipment to operate for five minutes.<br><br>
3. Place in operation the boiler being inspected. Follow the lighting instructions. Adjust thermostat so the boiler will operate continuously.<br><br>
4. Test for spillage at the draft control device relief opening after 5 minutes of main burner operation.<br><br>
5. After it has been determined that each appliance remaining connected to the common venting system properly vents when tested as outlined above, return doors, windows, exhaust fans, fireplace dampers and any other gas burning appliance to their previous condition of use.<br><br>
6. Any improper operation of the common venting system shall be corrected in a permanent manner.<br><br>

<big>Existing B-Vent (not certified for exterior applications) which has been installed outdoors</big><br><br>
OWNER / USER NOTIFICATION<br>

Attention Property Owner/User:<br>
The Technical Standards and Safety Authority (TSSA) is concerned that certain natural gas and propane burning appliances, such as furnaces and water heaters, are vented using B-Vents (not certified for exterior applications) which have been installed outdoors (See figures on page 2 for illustration). This application may pose a carbon monoxide (CO) safety hazard in the home due to extreme cold temperature conditions; as well, these vents may be subject to accelerated deterioration.
CO is a colourless, odourless, tasteless gas produced when fuels such as natural gas and propane burn incompletely. Symptoms of CO poisoning include nausea and vomiting, dizziness, burning eyes, difficulty breathing, confusion and loss of consciousness.<br><br>
TSSA has the mandate to maintain and improve safety for Ontario citizens in the fuels and other regulated sectors. TSSA is officially designated by Ontario’s Ministry of Government and Consumer Services to administer and enforce the Technical Standards and Safety Act, which governs fuels safety in Ontario.
Analysis of data regarding these outdoor B-Vent installations revealed that the likelihood of a safety hazard occurring is low; however, there is always the possibility of an incident occurring. With this information, TSSA has worked with industry to develop options for the owner/user who has a non-compliant B-Vent installed on the exterior wall of their premise.<br><br>

These options are:<br>
1. Replace the non-compliant B-Vent with a current code compliant venting system; or<br>
2. Leave the non-compliant B-Vent in use provided:<br>
a. It is in safe operating condition as determined by a qualified certificate holder (gas technician)<br>
b. It continues to be in safe operating condition as determined through annual inspections by a qualified certificate holder (gas technician) arranged by the premise owner/user<br>
c. When a gas appliance is replaced, removed, or a new appliance installed, the non-compliant B-Vent shall be replaced with a current code compliant venting system.<br><br>
TSSA and the associated industries thank you in advance for your co-operation in this regard. If you require further clarification or have questions, please ask the gas technician performing the inspection, your fuel supplier or TSSA toll-free at 1-877-682-8772.

Existing B-Vent (not certified for exterior applications) which has been installed outdoors<br><br>

SAFETY REMINDER<br>
Dear Name of Owner/User:<br>
Your premise has an existing B-Vent (not certified for exterior applications) which has been installed outdoors.<br>
Ontario Regulation 212/01, Clause 14 (1)(a) made under the Technical Standards and Safety Act requires that code non-compliances that do not pose an immediate hazard be corrected within 90 days. Many of these non-compliant venting systems were installed throughout Ontario and have operated safely for many years. In order to facilitate their continued safe use, a Director’s Order (FS-051-04) was issued which allowed the existing B-Vent to be left in use with several provisions.<br><br>
When this non-compliance was discovered, the owner/user of the premises at the time was given
information sheet that had the following options:<br><br>
1. Replace the existing B-Vent not certified for exterior applications with a current code compliant venting system, or<br>
2. Leave the existing B-Vent not certified for exterior applications in use with the following provisions:<br>
a. It is in safe operating condition as determined by a qualified certificate holder (gas technician);<br>
b. It continues to be in safe operating condition as determined through annual inspections by a qualified certificate holder (gas technician) which are arranged by the premise owner/user;<br>
c. When a gas appliance is replaced, removed, or a new appliance installed, the non-compliant B-Vent shall be replaced with a current code compliant venting system.<br>
Our records show that after inspection the existing B-Vent was left in use. You are required to have this B-Vent annually inspected by a heating contractor registered by TSSA to best ensure its continued safe operation. This notice is to remind you of this requirement. In the interest of safety, please have this inspection completed promptly.<br><br>
Yours truly,<br><br>
