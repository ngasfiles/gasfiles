<b>9.7.1  General</b><br>
When microprocessors are used as a primary safeguard device they shall conform to CSA C22.2 No. 0.8, and the requirements of 
Clause 9.7.2 shall apply. <br>
<small>Note: Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and distributed control systems (DCSs) form pairs of a family of microprocessor-based burner management systems (BMSs) and diverse sequence control applications. These devices execute 
their application programs in a rigidly organized sequential manner. They are extensively used because of their high 
reliability and their fault-diagnostic capabilities. In recent years, the functionality and use of the two processors, PLCs and DCSs, have become very similar, and for the purpose of these requirements, they are designated microprocessor-based 
systems. The authority having jurisdiction may require that the burner management systems (BMS) be designed in accordance 
with internationally recognized safety standards such as the IEC 61511 series of Standards, NFPA 85, or NFPA 86.
</small><br><br>

<big><u>9.7.2  Programmable controllers</big></u><br><br>

<b>9.7.2.1</b><br>
Programmable controllers may be used for the monitoring, sequencing, and control of all aspects of burner or process, or both, subject to Clause 9.7.2.2.<br><br>

The system designer shall be experienced in the design and implementation of microprocessor-based systems hardware and have proven background in the design of burner management systems. The designer shall be solely responsible for both logic development and logic software conversion. The designer shall be completely familiar with the specific features and weaknesses of the particular hardware being used, its failure modes, and any potential impact that a failure in 
any part of the BMS would have on its operation, equipment, personnel, and the environment. No single point of failure in any part of the BMS shall result in an uncontrollable condition, render the system inoperative, or place the system in a 
condition that would cause the operator to unknowingly create a hazardous situation.<br><br>

<b>9.7.2.2</b><br>
The microprocessor-based system shall be solely dedicated to the BMS. Logic for functions other than the BMS applications shall not be part of the I/O structure, memory, or software program. The following requirements shall apply:<br>
(a)   The software program for the BMS shall reside in some form of non-volatile memory storage. Acceptable memory storage devices shall be EEPROM, Flash ROM, battery-backed RAM, or EAPROM. Processors using battery-backed RAM shall automatically monitor battery voltage, activating and maintaining an alarm on impending low-battery voltage. A fully expired battery shall have no effect on memory storage as long as the processor is being supplied from the main power source.<br>
(b)   A watchdog timer internal to the BMS processor shall monitor the program scan time. In the event of an occurrence of a non-deterministic condition, all outputs shall de-energize, resulting in an immediate master fuel trip. The time allowed for a single processor scan shall not exceed three times the predefined scan time.<br>
In addition to the internal watchdog timer, an external watchdog timer featuring timed-on and timed-off delays shall be incorporated into the system design. This device shall monitor a dedicated output channel controlled by the processor at a frequency directly related to the processor scan time. The watchdog circuit shall be hard-wired to the master fuel trip circuit to immediately de-energize the main trip valves and associated vent valves.<br>
(c)   In the event of a power failure, the microprocessor-based system hardware and software shall not prevent the system from reverting to a fire-safe condition. A safe condition shall be maintained upon restoration of power.<br>
(d)   The BMS shall be equipped with a master fuel trip relay that shall de-energize when a master fuel trip command caused by operator intervention or by any of the critical system processes or component failures are present. It shall directly de-energize the main burner and main igniter header safety trip valves and associated vent valves; their operation shall result in a fire-safe condition. No logic sequence, or device, that allows momentary closing and subsequent inadvertent re-opening of the main or igniter fuel valves shall be permitted. Once a master fuel trip is initiated, it shall require operator action before operation of the affected burners can resume.<br>
(e)   Redundant processors with automatic transfer schemes shall be permitted. The designer shall be familiar with the conditions that would initiate a processor transfer and be fully satisfied that combustion safety is not compromised with the addition of redundancy hardware and/or the switching of processors.<br>
(f)    The designer of the BMS and the software for system operation shall provide the end user and the authority having jurisdiction with the documentation needed to verify that all related devices and safety logic are functional before the BMS is placed in operation. Passwords and/or entry level privileges shall be provided before access to the processor’s memory
 shall be permitted. Inadvertent memory erasure shall be prevented by restricted access and high-level password-protected software.<br>
The system designer shall be responsible for the distribution of the BMS software program and may transfer the password for memory access to the end user when documentation control procedures are in place. The end user shall not make program alterations without written approval from the system designer or a qualified proffessional engineer in conjunction with the system designer. The end user shall keep the written approval on file until the equipment or appliance is decommissioned.

Input channels for all critical signals shall incorporate a continuous self-test feature that satisfies the requirements of Clause 9.7.2.3.2 or 9.7.2.3.3, or they shall be hard-wired to the master fuel trip relay. Bypass switches for critical field inputs shall not be permitted.

<b>9.7.2.3.2</b><br>
The interrogation voltage to all critical field devices shall be periodically removed. Any channel recognized as faulty shall be alarmed and a BMS trip shall be activated.

<b>9.7.2.3.3</b><br>
One of two or two of three voting schemes may be implemented. Inputs via communications between the BMS and other microprocessor-based systems shall be permitted. Signals that initiate a master fuel trip shall be hard-wired. When 
analogue input signals associated directly with the BMS are used, the following shall apply:<br>
(a)   the analogue transmitter shall be dedicated to the BMS; and<br>
(b)   out-of-range signals shall default to the safe condition.
<br><br>

<b>9.7.2.4</b><br>
BMS outputs shall be supervised for false triggering.<br>
Interposing relays shall only be used where the power demand exceeds the power rating of the output module or where the operating voltage for the field device is outside of the range offered by the output modules. Where interposing relays are used, the relay shall be sized to the voltage and current requirements of the equipment being controlled and shall be 
equipped with arc suppression devices designed for the application.Electronic output switches or dry relay contacts may be used in systems operating on AC voltages. They shall have a rating sufficient to control the application in both ON/OFF and continuous operations.
<br><br>

<b>9.7.2.5</b><br>
Video interfaces shall be permitted but shall remain passive in their operation, providing only a window into the application and an ability to communicate operator write instructions to the BMS processor such as start/stop, open/close, or trip/reset commands. Video communication update times shall not compromise system safety. In the event of a communication failure, the video display shall default to a fail-safe condition, and there shall be an unambiguous text reference to the fact that the display is not current.
<br><br>

<b>9.7.2.6</b><br>
Functional testing shall be performed on the complete system prior to shipment to the end user. Functional testing shall include all aspects of the BMS, including the hard-wired tripping circuit, processor scan time, and I/O scan time. Where 
videographical display systems are involved in control selection and display, video response times shall be tested and recorded for all time-critical BMS control loops.Functional testing shall also be performed after the system is installed at the user’s location. It shall include all aspects of the BMS, including the hard-wired tripping circuit.
<br><br>

<b>9.7.2.7</b><br>
The system designer shall develop complete system documentation, which shall include the following:<br>
(a)   functional logic diagrams complete with timer and counter presets;<br>
(b)   power distribution drawings;<br>
(c)   a list of all error and alarm messages, their meaning, and suggested operator reactions;<br>

<h1>Annex A (informative)</h1>
<big>Recommended procedure for initial start-up 
of high input equipment [over 400 000 Btuh 
(120 kW)]</big><br><br>
<small>Note: This Annex is not a mandatory part of this Code but is written in mandatory language to accommodate its adoption 
by anyone wishing to do so.
<br><br>
This procedure has been developed to help ensure safe start-up of high input gas-fired equipment. Because of a large variation in the types of equipment and controls, some of the procedures as set out are not applicable to certain burners. On some equipment, other safety checks are required that may not be mentioned in this procedure.
<br><br>

The commercial and industrial installer responsible for the installation shall be present during the initial start-up. This person will be required to demonstrate that the installation meets all relevant codes, including the testing of piping and 
the checking of safety controls and electrical connections, safety interlocks, and relief valve ratings.
<br><br>

The installer shall ensure that all persons not directly involved in the start-up be cleared from the room in which the 
equipment is located before start-up is attempted.
<br><br>

A dry run shall be carried out with all manual gas valves closed to determine that all controls are in a safe operating condition before gas is supplied to the burner or pilot. It is suggested that the dry run checks will take a minimum of four control cycles to perform. The dry run checks can be carried out as follows:<br><br>
</small>
<b>1.First cycle</b><br>
For the first cycle, perform the following checks:<br>
(a)   Determine the movement or position of the air dampers during prepurge to ensure that the airflow is 
not less than 60% of that required for the maximum input to the unit during this period.<br>
(b)   Check the volume of prepurge air to determine its conformance with Code standards (at least four air changes of the 
combustionchamber and flue passages).<br>
(c)   At the end of the prepurge cycle, check the modulating gas valve and air damper to determine that they have returned to the low-fire position.<br><br>

<b>2.Second cycle</b><br>
During prepurge, simulate failure of the airflow or forced-fan operation and ensure that ignition spark does not occur. Failure may be simulated by failing a motor, closing a damper, removing a belt, removing a tubing connection from an air-proving device, or by other acceptable means.
<br><br>

<b>3.Third cycle</b><br>
Connect a meter to measure the scanner or detector signal. Check this reading during the ignition period to ensure that it reads zero. If there is a reading, the scanner or detector is sensing a false signal due to spark, etc.<br>
<small>Note: The meter should be connected according to the applicable specifications for the type and make of controls.</small><br><br>

<b>4.Fourth cycle</b><br>
Subject the scanner or detector to a simulated flame and check that<br>
(a)   the pilot proved (determined by Item (b));<br>
(b)   the main gas valve opens;<br>
(c)   the pilot is interrupted (ignition spark ceases);<br>
(d)   the trial for main flame is proven (the time between the opening of the main gas valve and the interruption of the spark);<br>
(e)   the loss of flame signal is proven when the simulated flame is removed (and the main gas valvecloses); and<br>
(f)    the manual reset valve, when used in conjunction with a firing valve that incorporates an end switch interlock, cannot be opened with the firingvalve in an open position (carried out by subjecting the scanner or detector to a simulated flame).<br><br>

The above procedure shall be carried out separately for each burner on a multi-burner unit.

<h1>Annex D (informative)</h1><br>
<big><u>Guidelines for fuel air ratio control (FARC) systems</big></u><br>
<small>Note: This Annex is not a mandatory part of this Code. However, it is written in mandatory language to accommodate 
adoption by the authority having jurisdiction.</small>
<br>
<br>
This Guideline provides a listing of some of the features that should be incorporated with typical fuel air ratio control (FARC) systems.<br><br>

Regardless of whether the provisions specified in this Guideline are satisfied, each application needs to be assessed to determine the suitability of the controller for the application.
<br><br>

When a certified FARC system is used, it shall be in compliance with ISO 23552-1.If a non-certified engineered FARC system is
 used, it shall comply with the following:
<br><br>

(a)   The entire FARC system shall be evaluated as a complete closed-loop system.<br>
(b)   Where the FARC system is of a positioning type,<br>
(i)    it shall have provisions for continuous feedback of all valve/damper/actuator positions to ensure that the command position has been achieved;<br>
(ii)   the inability of any of the valve/dampers or actuators to achieve the command position shall be detected and it shall prevent the associated valve/damper/actuator from traveling past the corresponding position;<br>
(iii)   the error tolerance in valve/damper/actuator position shall be within the appliance’s safe operating range at all firing rates. It shall take into account factors that may affect fuel or air mass flows such as gas pressure, voltage fluctuations, or flue blockage. An operating curve shall be declared at the time of commissioning, programmed into the controller, and clearly identified within the operating and maintenance instructions of the appliance;<br>
(iv)   fuel(s)/combustion air flow cross-limiting shall be incorporated in the control logic to ensure that the error tolerance in Subitem (iii) is not exceeded and that the burner does not operate in unsafe condition;<br>
(v)   upon detection of a valve/damper/actuator position fault or of another unsafe condition, the system shall revert to a 
risk-addressed state or cause the flame safeguard system to safely trip the burner;<br>
(vi)   assured sensing of valve/damper shaft position is required. Preferably this should be achieved through a shaft position sensor attached directly and securely to the shaft. If the sensor is attached to a linkage or an actuator, or is part of the actuator, all in-between connections shall be securely fastened to prevent slippage. Use of fastening methods that could become loose is not allowed;<br>
(vii)  the valve/damper/actuator assembly shall incorporate an external indication of open/close position. In many applications that use quarter-turn dampers, a permanent method of marking the damper position on the visible end of shaft may be acceptable. In other applications, marking of open/close position and, in some cases, marking of intermediate positions may be required in another accessible location;<br>
(viii)valve/damper/actuator purge and ignition (low-fire or light-off) position interlocks shall be incorporated and interlocked with the flame safeguard system; and<br>
(ix)  where a variable speed drive is incorporated into the combustion control system and used as the primary air flow control method, secondary feedback from current, fan speed, or flow sensor shall be used.<br>
(c)   Where the FARC system is of a metering type,<br>
(i)    it shall have provisions for continuous feedback of fuel(s) and combustion air flow(s) to ensure that the command air-to-fuel ratio is achieved;<br>
(ii)   where combustion air or fuel(s) pressure or temperature can change, appropriate temperature and pressure 
compensation shall be used;<br>
(iii)   where the calorific fuel value (Wobbe Index) can change, appropriate compensation shall be used;<br>
(iv)   the inability of any of the flows to achieve the command setpoint shall be detected, and it shall prevent the associated flow from changing past the corresponding position;<br>
(v)   the error tolerance in fuel(s) and combustion air flow readings shall be within the appliance’s safe operating limits at all firing rates. An operating curve shall be declared at the time of commissioning, programmed into the controller, and clearly identified within the operating and maintenance instructions of the appliance;<br>
(vi)   fuel(s)/combustion air flow cross-limiting shall be incorporated in the control logic to ensure that the error tolerance in Subitem (v) is not exceeded and that the burner does not operate in an unsafe condition;<br>
(vii)  for flow metering devices, the manufacturer shall declare the frequency of calibration, and this shall be documented within the service instructions;<br>
(viii) all connections between actuator and valve/damper shall be securely fastened to prevent slippage. Use of fastening methods that could become loose is not allowed;<br>
(ix)  the valve/damper/actuator assembly shall incorporate an external indication of open/close position. In many applications that use quarter-turn dampers, a permanent method of marking the damper position on the visible end of shaft may be acceptable. In other applications, marking of open/close position and, in some cases, marking of intermediate positions may be required in another accessible location; and<br>
(x)   if the air and fuel measurement system is not self-checking, valve/damper/actuator purge and ignition (low-fire or light-off) position interlocks shall be independent of the flow measurements and shall be incorporated and interlocked with 
the flame safeguard system.<br>
(d)   The FARC system may be also equipped with a checker device providing a redundant confirmation of valve/damper/actuator positions, fuel(s) or combustion air flow(s), pressures or temperatures, correct air-to-fuel ratio, or other system parameters that are important to safe FARC system operation. In some instances, special maintenance procedures may ha
ve to be included in order to test on a regular basis that both the primary sensing element and checker device function an
d calibration are correct.<br>
(e)   If a stack O2/CO/CO2 analyzer is used as a trim, the O2/CO/CO2 measurement shall not be used as the primary method of controlling combustion air flow. The O2/CO/CO2 trim control system shall be limited to ±10% correction of the combustion air flow or less as may be required by a specific application.<br>
(f)    The FARC system shall be interfaced and interlocked with the flame safeguard system to ensure that the required functionality is achieved. This includes an initial internal check to confirm that all components of the system are communicating, and confirmation of purge position, low-fire position, and fail-safe trip in the event that the FARC system detects a fault.<br>
(g)   The combustion control microprocessor may be independent from the burner management or incorporated into a PLC-based 
burner management system. Where applicable, the requirements of Clause 9.7 shall apply.<br>
(h)   If the air-to-fuel flow ratio, or air valve/damper-to-fuel valve position curves that are being stored in the controller, are field changeable, they shall be password protected.<br>
(i)    The FARC system/BMS shall provide an indication, alarm, or trip (appropriate to application) due to sensor fault, actuator fault, or FARC system fault condition.<br>
(j)    A shutdown shall be initiated should deviations in readings exceed a safe limit as declared by the burner
 manufacturer for that particular installation.<br>
(k)   The FARC system shall be protected from RF interference sources su
ch as VHF radios, cell phones, and variable-frequency drives.<br>
(l)    The FARC system shall be calibrated/commissioned by a qualified technician, recalibrated/ re-commissioned after any component is replaced, and checked/maintained on a regular basis as required to ensure its safe operation and as recommended by the equipment manufacturer.
